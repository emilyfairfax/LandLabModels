#Assignment for March 17th, 2016: Use Landlab to make a previous model 2D
<p> I used Landlab to make my overland flow models 2D. The codes for this week are titled OverlandFlowEFandGTChannel.py and OverlandFlowEFandGTSheet.py </p>
<p> The channel code is for water running down a v shaped channel (ie sloped in both x and y) under constant rainfall. This scenario is kind of like a creek. The sheet code is the water running off in a sheet over a simply inclined topography (ie its sloped in x but flat in y). This scenario is more like runoff on a highway or sidewalk. </p>
<p> These overland flow codes appear to be functioning, with much help from Greg Tucker and the Landlab tutorials. I had a code up earlier that didn't work because of an issue in my Hedge array. I deleted that code. I had issues with my gradient calculations, and sign of the flux.</p>
<p>Any comments for improvements on the functioning codes are appreciated since I am very new to python/Landlab and know I still have a lot to learn!</p>
