<p> The Overland Flow model is currently making the water height at every other node equal to zero. I'm not sure why. The other nodes seem to be working fine. I got some help from Greg Tucker on the model, particularly setting boundary conditions and assigning the correct sign to my flux. Any comments that could help me fix the every other height being zero issue are appreciated.</p>
